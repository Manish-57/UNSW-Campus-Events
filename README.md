## 📌 Project Overview
The UNSW Student Events App, Unite, is designed for three primary user groups: students
seeking relevant events, event organisers needing a simple promotion platform, and campus
clubs/services aiming to boost engagement. Our mobile-first, map-based social app
connects students to events and organisers in real time. Unite offers personalised
recommendations, an interactive campus map, messaging between attendees and
organisers, and role-based functionality with one-tap switching between attendee and
organiser views.

**Key differentiators include:**
* Interactive Map – enables visual-first event discovery, replacing static event lists.
* Group Announcements – delivers organiser updates directly to attendees.
* Real-Time RSVP with CSV Export – streamlines attendance tracking for organisers.
* One-Tap Role Switch – instantly adapts the interface to match the user’s role.

**Problem Statement**
* “To create an interactive UNSW events app which allows university students, staff, and
organisers to find, create, and share university events to help elevate social experiences
across campus and expand engagement opportunities for student-led initiatives and
affiliated businesses.”
